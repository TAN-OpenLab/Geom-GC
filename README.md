# Geom-GC
Fast Garbled Circuits: Geometry-based Gates
This project implements Geom-GC based on geometry transform.
In this project, **main.py, GC.py, ot.py and util.py** are based on https://github.com/ojroques/garbled-circuit, which implements Yao's GC. We make some changes of their work according to our framework. 
**geom. py** is implemented by ourself, which constructs seven kinds of geometric-based gates of NOT, AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR and NXOR.
